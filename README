Blake Stone: Planet Strike Source Code Release - July 5, 2013.

Please note that this is being released without any kind of support
from the original developers of this game or Apogee Software, LLC, Apogee
Software, Ltd / 3D Realms Entertainment.  

We are releasing this code for the entertainment of the user community. This is
all the source we have relating to Blake Stone: Planet Strike.  We haven't
looked at this stuff in years, and make no guarantee that you will be able to
get it to work, nor do we guarantee that it won't blow up your computer if you
do try and use it. ;)

You will need the data from a released version of Blake Stone: Planet Strike to
use the .exe built from this code. We cannot and will not help in getting this
running.

Caveat Emptor - Use at your own risk.

Please note that while we are releasing the source code to Blake Stone: Planet
Strike, the game itself has not been released in the same manner (in other
words, Blake Stone: Planet Strike is still commercial software).  You can still
buy the game from us by visiting the Apogee Software online store at
http://apogeesoftware.com/products/blake-stone-planet-strike or GOG.com at
http://www.gog.com/gamecard/blake_stone_planet_strike. 

Thanks to all the fans who have enjoyed the game and to those that have
contacted us about the possibility of releasing this source. If you produce
something cool with this source code, drop us a line at info@apogeesoftware.com
